In my github space you'll find a small selection of software tools targeted at the geospatial domain. Most of these tools are in various stages of development, some pretty rough-and-ready, others slightly more polished.\r\n\r\n### cdlparser\r\nThis is a Python module for parsing text files encoded in netCDF Common Data form Language, a.k.a. CDL. The current module can only handle the CDL syntax associated with netCDF version 3 (i.e. 'classic' netCDF). I'd like to add support for the netCDF v4 CDL syntax at some point.\r\n\r\n### crswkt\r\nThis is another Python parsing module: this time for parsing coordinate reference systems specified in OGC well-known text (WKT) format.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n@rockdoc","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
