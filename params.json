In my [github space](https://github.com/rockdoc) you'll find a small selection of software tools targeted at the geospatial software domain. Most of these tools are in various stages of development, some pretty rough-and-ready, others slightly more polished. A couple of the packages are described below.\r\n\r\n### CDL Parser\r\n[cdlparser](https://github.com/rockdoc/cdlparser) is a Python module for parsing text files encoded in netCDF's Common Data form Language, a.k.a. CDL. At present the ``cdlparser`` module can only handle the CDL syntax associated with netCDF version 3 (i.e. 'classic' netCDF). I'd like to add support for the netCDF v4 CDL syntax at some point.\r\n\r\n### CRS WKT Parser\r\n[crswkt](https://github.com/rockdoc/crswkt) is another Python parsing module: this time for parsing coordinate reference systems specified in OGC well-known text (WKT) format. CRS WKT strings are used in many of today's geographic information systems.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n@rockdoc","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
